| :-- | :-- | :--
| Distro | Debian 12 Bookworm | I need a comfortable, stable (boring) and respectable distro - Debian
| Terminal | Wezterm | Often recommended modern terminal with rich configuration
| Shell | Zsh + OhMyZSH | Simply great tool, one of first fancy Linux tools I have used
| Editor | Visual Studio Code | Fast, powerfull extensions, great JSON configuration files
| Window manager | i3 | Simple, conservative option for ricing Linux, doesn't shout that my distro has packages dated 2 years ago and GCC doesn't support C++26

| Launcher | Rofi | Simple, conservative option for ricing Linux
| Notifications | Dunst | Simple, conservative option for ricing Linux
